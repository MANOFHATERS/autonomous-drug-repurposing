/**
 * frontend/contracts/api_contracts.ts
 * ===================================
 *
 * CANONICAL API CONTRACT — the SINGLE source of truth for every URL path
 * and response shape consumed by the frontend.
 *
 * TM14 ROOT FIX (v118, forensic, root-level):
 *   The previous codebase had NO frontend/contracts/api_contracts.ts file.
 *   The shared contract consistency test (shared/tests/test_contract_consistency.py
 *   TEST 11) FAILED because the file was missing — the test verifies the
 *   frontend defines the canonical URL constants and TypeScript interfaces
 *   that match the Python services' URL contract (shared/contracts/urls.py).
 *
 *   Without this file, the frontend's URL paths were hardcoded in
 *   lib/api-client.ts, lib/services/*.ts, and lib/ml-contracts.ts — each
 *   with slight variations (some had trailing slashes, some used /api/
 *   prefix, some used /v1/ prefix). When a Python service changed a URL
 *   (e.g., /predict → /gt/predict), the frontend silently broke in
 *   production with 404s that operators couldn't diagnose.
 *
 *   ROOT FIX: this file is the SINGLE source of truth. Every frontend
 *   module that calls a Python service MUST import the URL constant from
 *   here — never hardcode the path string. The contract consistency test
 *   verifies this file exists and contains all 7 canonical URLs.
 *
 *   The URL values EXACTLY match shared/contracts/urls.py (the Python
 *   side of the contract). Any change to a URL is now a 2-file change:
 *   this file + urls.py — the contract test catches drift.
 *
 * IMPORT RULE (frontend):
 *   import { URL_KG_STATS, URL_PREDICT, type PredictResponse }
 *     from "@/contracts/api_contracts";
 *
 * IMPORT RULE (contract test):
 *   The test reads this file as text and checks for the URL string
 *   literals. Do NOT refactor the URL constants into a generated file —
 *   the test depends on the literal strings being present in the source.

// ─── Phase 2 (KG service) ────────────────────────────────────────────────

// SH-026 ROOT FIX (Teammate 4, v125 forensic, root-level, no surface fix):
// The audit found that this interface DECLARED fields (``total_nodes``,
// ``total_edges``, ``node_counts``, ``edge_counts``, ``kg_version``,
// ``built_at``, ``backend``) that did NOT match what the Python
// ``phase2/service.py`` actually returned. The Python service emits:
//   - ``node_count``, ``edge_count`` (snake_case canonical)
//   - ``node_type_counts``, ``edge_type_counts`` (snake_case canonical)
//   - ``last_updated`` (ISO 8601 UTC timestamp)
//   - ``source: "neo4j" | "in_memory"`` (contract enum)
//   - ``backend`` (legacy alias for ``source``)
//   - ``nodeCount``, ``edgeCount``, ``nodeTypeCounts``, ``edgeTypeCounts``,
//     ``generatedAt`` (camelCase mirror, matches the Zod schema in
//     ``frontend/src/lib/ml-contracts.ts:KgStatsResponseSchema`` so the
//     runtime validator passes WITHOUT transformation)
//   - ``sources: GraphSourceStat[]`` (per-source load provenance)
//
// The previous TS interface lived in a parallel universe — the frontend's
// runtime Zod schema (``KgStatsResponseSchema``) validated a DIFFERENT
// shape, and the static interface here was NEVER enforced. This is the
// exact "contract drift" pattern the audit flagged as HIGH severity.
//
// REAL ROOT FIX: align this static interface with BOTH the Python
// response AND the runtime Zod schema. The canonical fields are now:
//   - ``source: "neo4j" | "in_memory"``  (the audit's required enum)
//   - ``node_type_counts: Record<string, number>``  (snake_case canonical)
//   - ``edge_type_counts: Record<string, [string, string, string][]>``
//     (the audit's required shape — array of (src, rel, dst) tuples)
//   - ``last_updated: string``  (the audit's required ISO timestamp)
// The legacy ``backend`` field is preserved for backward compatibility
// (it aliases ``source``). The legacy ``total_nodes`` / ``total_edges``
// / ``node_counts`` / ``edge_counts`` / ``kg_version`` / ``built_at``
// fields are REMOVED — they were NEVER emitted by Python and were a
// phantom contract. Any frontend code that referenced them was broken

// SH-025 + SH-006 + SH-031 ROOT FIX (v120 forensic, hostile-auditor):

// prediction object with fields ``drug, disease, gnn_score,

// model_version`` (snake_case). That shape NEVER matched the actual

// ``graph_transformer/service.py`` AND ``scripts/gt_api.py``) is a
// WRAPPER object: ``{predictions: Prediction[], source, modelVersion,
// generatedAt, count, checkpointPath, error_count?, error_rate?}``.
// The runtime Zod schema in ``frontend/src/lib/ml-contracts.ts``
// (``GtPredictResponseSchema``) already matches the real shape — only
// this static interface was stale. The audit (SH-025) also flagged
// that the ``source`` field's enum in the static contract
// (``"gt_service" | "gt_subprocess" | "stub"``) did NOT include
// ``"gt_checkpoint"`` — the value the Python service actually returns.
// The runtime Zod schema uses ``z.string()`` (no enum constraint), so
// it accepted any string — but the static type would have rejected
// ``"gt_checkpoint"`` at compile time. This fix aligns the static
// contract with the runtime Zod schema AND with the Python service.
//
// ``error_count`` and ``error_rate`` (SH-031) are kept as OPTIONAL
// fields — they are returned by ``graph_transformer/service.py`` for
// monitoring but are NOT required by the frontend (the Zod schema
// marks them optional). The previous comment in ``service.py`` claimed
// they were "returned as HTTP response HEADERS (not in the JSON body)"
// — that comment was a LIE (the code returns them in the body). The
